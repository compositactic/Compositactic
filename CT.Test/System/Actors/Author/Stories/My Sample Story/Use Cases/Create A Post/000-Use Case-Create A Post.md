# Use Case - Create a [Post](../../../../../../Model/Blog/Post/000-Model-Post.md)

##### Type: [Process/Command]
##### Other Actors: [Actor 1, Actor 2]

##### Steps - [Sequential/Random]

1. [Actor] [performs some action] [preposition] [Actor(s)/Composite(s)]
2. ...

##### Step Exceptions

+ other random failure1
    + [Actor] [performs some action] [preposition] [Actor(s)/Composite(s)]
    + [Actor] [performs some action] [preposition] [Actor(s)/Composite(s)]
+ Other random failure2

1. Actor failures (for Step 1)
    + Failure Condition 1 description
        + [Actor] [performs some action] [preposition] [Actor(s)/Composite(s)]
        + [Actor] [performs some action] [preposition] [Actor(s)/Composite(s)]
    + Failure Condition 2 description
2. Actor failures (for Step 2)
    + Failure Condition 1 description
        + [Actor] [performs some action] [preposition] [Actor(s)/Composite(s)]
        + [Actor] [performs some action] [preposition] [Actor(s)/Composite(s)] 
    + Failure Condition 2 description
        + [Actor] [performs some action] [preposition] [Actor(s)/Composite(s)]
        + [Actor] [performs some action] [preposition] [Actor(s)/Composite(s)]
